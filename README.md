**Introduction**
I received this test assignment from the WebGurus team and was excited to start working on it.
In this documentation, I describe in detail how I understood the task, how I approached the problem, and how I implemented the solution step by step.
My goal is to explain the system's logic and my thinking in a clear and understandable way.

**1. Understanding the Task**
When I first read the task description, it seemed complex, so I decided to ask ChatGPT for help in order to better understand it.
I approached it as if I were asking a client for more details and clarifications about the requirements.
I believe that before I start coding, it's important to thoroughly understand the problem, so I can avoid going in the wrong direction during implementation.
As the next step, I tried to break the problem into smaller parts and started building a working solution based on that.
